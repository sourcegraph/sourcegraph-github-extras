## Known issues

This extension is experimental.

- The GitHub API request is sent each time the page loads. This is likely to cause you to hit the GitHub API rate limit (for unauthenticated users, it's 60 requests per minute).
- When you navigate to a different repository, the pull requests panel still shows the list from the first repository you viewed. Reload your browser to refresh the list.
